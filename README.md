# Templates for TypeScript applications

* Backend - Typescript + NodeJS
* Frontend - Typescript + React
* Library - Typescript library converted to JS
* React Library - Typescript library for React components


## TODO

* READMEs with instructions to all generated repos
* Remake so there is no need for long list of files with src and target
* Remake so there is no need for lists of directories to create

## Deploy

If you have NPM access:

- yarn build
- npm login
- npm publish
